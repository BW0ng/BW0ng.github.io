I'm a 24 year old millennial who has just started adulting and realized how woefully unprepared I am. I've gone through all the stages that anyone fresh out of school has done: spending money recklessly only to find yourself going back to the good old college days of the ramen dinners. Rinse and repeat. However, I've realized that there must be more to life. Like saving enough money in my 401k that way I can brag to others that I can live on the more expensive ramen during retirement.

### Reasoning for Starting this Blog

A couple reasons motivated me to start this blog. The major reason was for myself. To have a way to document some of the things that I found while trying to become financially literate and to have a place that I can refer to. Another reason was looking around at my friends and family, many of them not knowing the difference between a Roth IRA or a 401k, not being able to calcuate the worth of a bond, not knowing what a covered call is (hint: it's not when you make your parents pay for all your calls), etc. So this is me trying to do my part to make sure that people can retire and not have to work in their 70+ because they don't have any retirement funds and Social Security ran out.
